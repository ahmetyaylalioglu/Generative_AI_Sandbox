Instructions
------------
You need to run all cells specified order in the jupyter notebook file.
Before you run all cells you need to specify you Open AI API Key in to my_api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here" line in the first cell
Then you can write a query in the "user_input" in the 10th cell in the Jupyter Notebook file. 
You can see answers after final you run final cell


Step 1: Environment Setup
First, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running the following command in your terminal:

python --version
If you do not have Python installed or need a different version, download and install it from python.org.

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Open your command line interface (CLI) and execute the following commands to install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install langchain openai chromadb

Step 3: Set Up Jupyter Notebook
If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it via pip:

pip install notebook
To start the Jupyter Notebook, run:
jupyter notebook
This command will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.

Step 4: Configuring Your Jupyter Notebook
Open Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb).
In the first cell of your notebook, enter the following code to import necessary libraries and configure your OpenAI API key:

# Replace 'your_openai_api_key_here' with your actual OpenAI API key
my_api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"

Step 5: Running Code Cells in Specific Order
Navigate to the ninth cell in your notebook (or as directed in the notebook instructions).
Enter your query in the user_input variable:
user_input = "Enter your query here"
Replace "Enter your query here" with the query you want to run.

Execute all cells in the specified order by running each one sequentially from top to bottom or by using the 'Run All' option in the 'Cell' menu.

Step 6: Obtain Results
After running the final cell in the Jupyter Notebook, check the output below each cell to see the results and answers generated by the code.
